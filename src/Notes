NPM I react-slick --save ,and npm i slick-carousel react used to make movie carosel 

import slider from react slick 
import slick css for carousel

in imgSlider.js, we destructured carousel with {...settings}
so that the settings we created apply to all carousels

Use styled components to style components in file

overflow = content that overflows your view width
you can hide it
 
.slick-list {
    overflow : visible // allows slide to show
     piece of previous or next slide 
}

Ex: &:hover {
    concathenates the hover feature to the parent
     which would be const WRAP so that you 
     dont have to parent about putting
     wrap: hover;

}

using redux for state managment 

when using redux always start with initial state 

state is db for your app 
[ movies, user] state saves this in application state, the we can access it whenever we need

what is reducer

redux is made of reducers, actions and state

Action: something you want to do  log a user in , sign user in, delete user , delete movie etcetc

Reducer: takes action change data

State: will state change to all components
